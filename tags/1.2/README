2010 Magnus Kulke

Requirements:

- nagios
- mod-wsgi for apache (configuration example in "apache/")
- python-lxml

Optional (when Balbec is not installed on the Nagios host):

- ndo2db with mysql (see the documentation included in ndoutils on how to set up NDO)
- python-mysql

Installation:

- If not yet present add a wsgi option "WSGIPythonPath /opt/wsgi" to the apache configuration.
- Move all files in "src/" to "/opt/wsgi/balbec".
- Move "balbec.wsgi", "config.xml", "xslt/" & "schema/" to "/opt/balbec".
- Adjust settings in "config.xml".

Configuration:

- see example config.xml file.
- a map includes several hostgroups and optionalal several filter hostgroups.
- setting the filter attribute "revert" to "true", makes the result include only the hosts in the filter hostgroups, by default those are filtered out.
- reverted filters are combined using "or", normal filters with "and".  

Usage:

Use the browser to view the maps in html ("Accept: text/html" in the header) or use xml for further processing: "curl -s http://balbec".
